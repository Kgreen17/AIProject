Regression types:
1. Ridge Regression - definition: It is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term (L2 penalty) to prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients of
                                    less important features towards zero.
2. Lasso Regression - definition: It is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term (L1 penalty) which can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero,
                                    effectively performing feature selection.
3. Elastic Net Regression - definition: It is a hybrid of Ridge and Lasso regression that combines both L1 and L2 penalties, allowing for both coefficient shrinkage and
                                        feature selection.
